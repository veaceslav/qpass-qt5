QPass is easy to use, open source password manager application. It
enables you to store your confidential data crypted. All entries are
stored in a signle file database encrypted using AES-256 algorithm.
Each entry can contain name, url, username, password and description. 

It can stay running in tray so your data can be close at hand. With
password generator you can generate strong passwords. 

QPass is written in C++ and it uses Qt5 and libgcrypt as GUI and
cryptographic library.
